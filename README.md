# Data Analysis with Visualization


Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree
## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. It is divided into two main parts:

### Part I: Exploratory Data Visualization
In this phase, Python visualization libraries are used to systematically explore a selected dataset. The visual analysis begins with single-variable plots and progresses toward more complex multi-variable relationships.

### Part II: Explanatory Data Visualization
In the second phase, the most interesting patterns and trends discovered earlier are communicated through clear, effective, and polished visualizations. The goal is to tell a data-driven story using appropriate design and visualization techniques.
